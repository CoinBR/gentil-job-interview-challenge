## Using and Evaluating the solution:

### odoo app:

1. [http://localhost:8069/](http://localhost:8069/)
2.   email: **coinbr@gmail.com**
3.	 password: **senha**

### API consumer and provider:
[http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)

## Understanding the Solution

### odoo / web-app

 - I was assigned to create a to-do list, using [odoo](https://www.odoo.com/) (OpenERP)
 - It should have many type of views
 - Also, I was asked to add a field "Mother name" to **res.partner**, and create appropriate views and inherited model
 - Also, It should be possible to assign a **task** to a **res.partner**

### API
- I should prove that I was able to:
	- Access  the odoo api,
	- Authenticate on the odoo api
	- Consume **res.partner**s information, using the API

- So, I created my own simple REST Api:
	- It do all that was asked above (using python)
	- Gets a list off all partners that have the field "mother_name" filled 
	- Gets partner and mother names, for all partners found in the previous step 
	- Serve in my own simple REST API (using flask), the info gathered in the previous step, along with the partner id.
